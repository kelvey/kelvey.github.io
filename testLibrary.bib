Specifically, we analyse 10 public investigations started as a reaction to a major crisis in regenerative medicine at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, associated with the clinician-scientist Paolo Macchiarini. We interpret the reaction as an attempt to restore the balance between the stimulation and regulation of technological innovation processes by clarifying ambiguities in the regulation at the interface between research and practice. We conceptualise these ambiguities as grey zones – situations when it is unclear if the benefits of experimentation outweigh its risks – and propose that grey zones are continually created and resolved as actors in innovation governance systems counterbalance the generation of novelty and the risk of negative unintended consequences.},

We consolidate what is known about the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents of academic engagement, and its consequences for research, commercialisation, and society at large. Our results suggest that individual characteristics associated with academic engagement include being scientifically productive, senior, male, locally trained, and commercially experienced. Academic engagement is also socially conditioned by peer effects and disciplinary characteristics. In terms of consequences, academic engagement is positively associated with academics’ subsequent scientific productivity. We propose new areas of investigation where evidence remains inconclusive, including individual life cycle effects, the role of organisational contexts and incentives, cross-national comparisons, and the impact of academic engagement on the quality of subsequent research as well as the educational, commercial and society-wide impact.},

However, collaborating for innovation requires that firms overcome the paradox of openness, i.e., they need to be open to collaboration to innovate and at the same time protect their internal knowledge and intellectual assets to appropriate value from their innovations. The aim of this paper is to investigate how knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial ({KIE}) firms can overcome this paradox—which is an important barrier to future transitions—by choosing a combination of collaborative partners and appropriability strategies that support their ability to create more radical innovations. We analyze a sample of over 2450 {KIE} firms, drawing from a cross-European survey. Our results indicate how different partners, and different appropriability strategies, are more, or less, relevant to the generation of the radical innovations needed to transform society into one with a sustainable future; university collaboration and the use of formal protection mechanisms seem especially important for such new-to-the-world innovations. Our study includes important policy implications for how to support and promote future sustainable transitions and also establishes a foundation for future lines of research regarding entrepreneurship and sustainable transition.},

Western countries have long taken the lead in developing knowledge and transforming it into business and social innovation, but in recent decades, the Chinese economy has been rapidly advancing. Chinese firms are developing innovative capabilities and engaging in globalization, which affects not only China but also the world. Our theoretical view from Schumpeterian and evolutionary economics is that in the modern economy, the competitiveness of firms depends upon their use of advanced knowledge for innovation as well as their ability to act globally. This book addresses these themes: 1) Specifying where innovation systems can affect the ability of Chinese firms to identify and act upon innovative opportunities; 2) Analyzing why Chinese firms’ acquisitions and collaboration can affect their capabilities for technology, innovation and globalization; 3) Exploring how Chinese firms develop new capabilities.},

However, the reverse innovation taken by enterprises from developing countries is still under research.

	abstract = {This chapter explores industrial {PhD} students, including their activities and their perceptions of the impact of their studies and of their role in university–firm interaction on firm innovation. The limited number of previous studies of industrial {PhD} students mainly focus on broader issues related to these students’ educational experience and learning outcomes (Thune 2009), whereas studies of {PhD} students moving to industry generally focus not on their activities during education but rather on what happens after graduation (e.g., Cruz-Castro \& Sanz-Menéndez 2005; Garcia-Quevedo et al. 2011; Roach \& Sauermann 2010). Here, we consider a specific empirical phenomenon, namely, industrial {PhD} students during their education, when they are simultaneously involved in both the university and the firm. Because little research considers our phenomenon, we address two questions through detailed qualitative research, within the empirical context of collaborative research in the field of engineering in Sweden. Given the lack of previous research on this topic, our first question is, How to define an industrial {PhD} student? To answer this, we consider the conditions for education and employment, their specific activities, and the frequency of activities bridging the university and firm. Then we seek to explore their perceived contribution to firm innovation during their education as {PhD} students, so our second question is What is the perception of how their activities impact upon firm innovation? To conceptualize this, we first present an existing conceptual framework for academic engagement with industry, and further elaborating on underlying concepts in order to develop a detailed analysis of the the micro-level activities of these {PhD} students. Our results identify several activities of these industrial {PhD} students that merit analysis in future research, and specifically in relation to the development of firm capabilities for innovation.},

One thing they do is to support a wide variety of projects, initiated by different types of potential founders. In this paper, we investigate which project and incubator characteristics explain the likelihood of different types of founders to turn their projects into knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial ({KIE}) firms. We address two gaps in the literature: how university incubators function and how the diverse backgrounds of different types of founders (researchers, students, other university employees, independent inventors and corporate spinoffs) may affect their likelihood of completing incubation and becoming a {KIE} firm. In line with previous research, we find that incubation projects initiated by researchers have a lower probability to complete incubation than the other types. More surprisingly, having research-initiated projects in an incubator seems to create spillover effects on all other projects, increasing their likelihood of survival. Moreover, the probability of projects successfully completing incubation increases if the university incubator has less breadth, as measured in admitting fewer types of project-founders, and if the incubator has more experience, as measured in age."},

One is that universities have increasingly developed from bodies of professorial self-governance bodies towards a status as ‘complete’ organisational actors, able to develop and deploy organisation-level strategies. A second is that by becoming key players in the knowledge economy and responding to stakeholder expectations, universities also have taken on new missions in addition to teaching and research. We propose that a series of new challenges arise from interrelations between universities’ internal organisational dynamics and changes in their external relationships. Moreover, we outline the contributions to this special issue, each of which address a specific question through their respective conceptual discussion and/or in-depth examination of these challenges. We conclude with recommendations for future research on the roles of universities in the knowledge economy and for innovation. Specifically, we propose that future research should simultaneously tackle vital issues about governance of universities and their activities, while also further developing extant empirical work on the microfoundations of academic knowledge production and career dynamics.},

Moreover, the primary contribution of this study is to emphasize the support of the local government in the development of emerging industries on the perspective of the creation of a large-scale market demand. The creation of large-scale market demand may inspire actors to be proactive in responding to these incentives; thus, public and private actions may help increase the accessibility to technology, infrastructure, and finances.

	abstract = {This article contributes with an analysis of the specific linkages between knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship for industrial dynamics, within the emerging literature upon knowledge-intensive innovative entrepreneurial ({KIE}) firms. We find a distinct variety in the usefulness of different types of founder experience (single or teams) in the performance of entrepreneurial firms. This variety affects selection in the economy, as measured by the performance of firms in a two-stage process – namely first by analyzing survival over time and then of high growth rates. We do so in order to consider averages/probabilities in the population using Cox regression as well as of the outliers, using quantile regression. We find that on one hand, founders having previously started firms or worked in the same industry are more likely to survive. On the other hand, very high-growth firms have founders who previously started firms or worked in universities. Combining different types of founder experience in {KIE} firms has a consistently positive relationship with performance both in terms of survival and of growth. Our interpretation is that the variety of founder experience affect selection processes and opportunity recognition in {KIE} firms and thereby fundamentally affect whether, and to what extent, entrepreneurial actions lead to industrial transformation.},

Our proposed conceptualization of governance depends upon an understanding of how different ways of developing rules and norms to interact and make decisions collectively are created and maintained, including two sub-processes. One process is to develop advanced knowledge and the second process is where entrepreneurs transform that knowledge developed as the public good and privatize it through value creation. We propose that a main task for this type of entrepreneur is to manage their engagement in the overall governance in such a way as to be perceived by others as continuing to contribute to the collective action problem. The article provides definitions and propositions in relation to the conceptualization, as well as interesting trajectories for future research.},

In terms of how the chosen university has worked to initiate academic engagement, we find, in contrast to existing literature, how, what we call researcher-teachers, primarily used students to engage with a variety of external organisations, rather than relying on research excellence. University management offered support and made small investments. In terms of perceived benefits, the researcher-teachers, university managers and students all stressed positive reputational benefits, especially attracting female students into engineering and diffusing engineering knowledge in society. Acknowledging the limitations of our study, three propositions for future research are to conceptualise the university as providing knowledge-intensive services, to explore the potential involvement of university management, and to articulate different phases of academic engagement.},

Our empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset in pharmaceutical cancer research. We analyze publications originating in biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, with a comparison of the results to publications that do not involve a firm-based author. Our results indicate that the returns to the number of partners are decreasing and are negative after a turning point. More surprisingly, our results suggest that biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms should focus on establishing R\&D alliances with pharmaceutical firms in order to increase the probability of publishing in journals with a high reputation. However, in terms of scientific impact, i.e., forward citations, publications originating in firms do not benefit from having access to different types of alliance partners.},

As contrasted with studies of commercialization of scientific results through patents and start-up firms, literature on academic engagement focuses on how faculty members and students engage in knowledge-related interactions with external organizations. Extant literature has focused more on universities and less on firms. We conceptualize graduate students as holding a boundary spanning position between the firm and university, focusing empirically upon firm employed {PhD} students in engineering. More specifically, we investigate how their activities constitute a form of academic engagement, in order to further understand their influence on the firms’ absorptive capacity. We revise an existing conceptual framework and further develop the notion that there are two pathways – e.g. a direct and an indirect pathway – by which collaborative research may impact innovation outcomes within firms. When doing so, we specify how graduate student activities mainly support the development of firm capabilities for early stages in the innovation process, specifically recognizing the value and, to some extent, assimilating new external knowledge. We conclude with two propositions about how boundary spanner activities can be conceptualized as organizational routines underlying search capabilities."},

We identify four types using broad principles in terms of four different key variables described within. To identify our proposed types, we perform a cluster analysis of all 37 universities with entrepreneurship educations in one country. Previous literature provides mixed evidence about entrepreneurship programs’ effect on the likelihood of alumni starting a business afterwards. Our contribution is to specify this taxonomy through broad principles, leading to in-teresting questions about the competing goals between theory and practice in learning outcomes.

Public policy has facilitated the development of strategic priorities and niches for the {NEV} industry in Hangzhou, demonstrating the role of public policies in advancing the sectoral innovation system. Indeed, the rapid formation of policy stimulates the co-evolution of market and technical niches. More specifically, market niches—such as, in this case, the renting and sharing markets for {NEVs} in Hangzhou—drive technical niches because market scale provides benefits to manufacturers, who then conduct research and development to improve their technology and reduce production costs. Our case study further recommends that while the key purpose of the underlying policies—to promote the creation and growth of the emerging market—should remain the same, they also need to be adapted over time. This research suggests that the combination of public policy intended to create markets and the co-evolution of market and technical niches has enabled the rapid emergence of the innovation system for this nascent technology at an early phase.},

We do so in order to propose an explicitly evolutionary economics approach to conceptualizing changes in academic engagement with industry and society over time. Within the extensive literature on university-industry interactions, the literature on academic engagement focuses upon the variety of knowledge networks between university and industry for societal impact, and contrasts that with the commercialization of university research results through patents and start-up companies. We have an empirical focus upon the changing micro-level of activities in the university, to further conceptualize what routines are, and how are related to the overall growth of knowledge. Biomedical engineering is relevant to study, because different fields of knowledge must be combined and re-combined to solve new problems and offer new solutions to existing problems. For medical innovation, hospitals are important as well as industrial firms. Drawing on a longitudinal study of biomedical engineering at one university over seven decades, we identify four distinct modes of academic engagement. We propose to conceptualize these modes of academic engagement as composed of sets of distinct routines. In particular, we have identified routines related to interactions with hospitals, both directly and through industrial firms, involving graduate students and their supervisors.},

	abstract = {Innovation processes – as well as scientific research and technological development – rely upon a continuous process of generating new knowledge, arising from collaboration across a variety of private actors like firms, societal actors like universities, {NGOs} and professional societies, as well as public actors like government agencies (Fagerberg and Mowery, 2006). Developing new areas of scientific research will help society in the long run, but equally important are the uses of that knowledge in order to implement ideas, translate research into practise, and more generally, find ways of societal impact. Hence, the positive outcomes of these innovation processes benefit society in the long-run through new products, services, and organizational forms. Therefore, public policy to stimulate science, technology and innovation is usually designed to stimulate novelty, due to the potential future benefits for society (Edler and Fagerberg 2017). This view stresses the positive side of innovation. But in recent years, a number of studies have focused upon the negative consequences, risks or “dark side of innovation” (Nightingale 2004; Stirling 2017), whereby increasing public concerns about risks have led to demands for more inclusive and transparent innovation processes (Stilgoe et al 2013). Our three-year qualitative study analyses processes of innovation governance, within an empirical context of negative unintended consequences, namely scientific misconduct, in the specific setting at the interface between biomedical scientific research and clinical practice.},

While blended hybrids have been extensively investigated, few studies have examined how structural hybrids are constructed and maintained. We address this imbalance by studying university–industry research centers as instances of distinct organizational spaces used to engage with a minority logic. We found that these spaces require three kinds of work: (a) leveraging, where dominant logic practices are drawn on to achieve minority logic objectives; (b) hybridizing, where the practices inside the space are modified to allow engagement with the minority logic; and (c) bolstering, where the space is shielded against excessive minority logic influence and anchored back into the organization. Furthermore, contrary to the existing literature, we found that the spaces were hybrid, rather than being dominated by a single logic. Our finding is likely generalizable across many instances of structural hybrids given the integration problems that organizations with pure single logic spaces would face, combined with the usefulness of hybrid spaces. Our study is novel in revealing the work needed to sustain hybrid spaces and questioning the previously held conceptualization of structural hybrids as made up of single-logic compartments.},

Our analysis contributes to theoretical debates about how the entrepreneurs achieve this aim in order to develop their knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial ventures in creative industries. Our conceptualization specifies how entrepreneurs can use embeddedness in networks in order to access specific types of resources, during the pre-entry phase, the establishment phase, and the post-entry phase. The textiles and fashion industry is an interesting setting to explore these topics because of the rapid industrial transformation from mass production of textiles to large e-commerce firms. Our results suggest that pre-history of the individual entrepreneur has long-term effects upon access to unique resources within the industry, enabling this group to more quickly build their entrepreneurial ventures. Our qualitative case study contributes to theoretical discussions of how micro-processes of {KIE} entrepreneurship can renew regions and traditional industries, because our analysis shows the enduring impact of past industrial, regional and family ties.},

These cascades involve a long series of interlinked radicalinnovations, which can be traced through various scientific and technological indicatorslike patents and publications. Innovation cascades are relevant to industry, because theymake the future less predictable. They are particularly interesting because these changesalso enable the testing an abundance of new business models. Innovation cascades havea major impact on the number and sustainability of business models and on strategy.Business model innovations are visible not only in the existing organizations thatundergo change, but also new organizational models appear.

	abstract = {Public-policy makers in emerging economics often want to stimulate knowledge- intensive industries, as a means to catch-up with innovation-based advanced economies. Literature on regional innovation systems and ecosystems have extensively studied agglomeration effects, and often with a focus upon the particular role of stimulating universities and scientific research. Yet funding science is not enough, due to what we identify as three complex issues related to the development of capabilities in firms and public agencies at the local-global interface. In catch-up theory, public policy which stimulates science-based industries can be seen as policy reacting to a short window of technological opportunity. In this paper, we are specifically focused upon public-private co-evolution in the biotech-pharmaceutical industry, which is highly dependent upon internal R\&D and public science but also specific knowledge about national markets and global regulations. Based upon a seven-year qualitative study, we focus upon a science park in a second tier Chinese city, namely {BioBay} at Suzhou Industry Park. We propose a co-evolutionary process model of one element of the ecosystem, namely how increasing scale, learning and interactions between knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms and science parks lead to the development of both public and private capabilities to react upon this technological opportunity through entrepreneurship.},

	abstract = {Amongst the many definitions of ecosystems, this paper defines key attributes of the concept of knowledge-intensive innovative ecosystems. The concept of a knowledge-intensive innovative ecosystem focuses our attention upon how specialized knowledge is directly related to innovation and entrepreneurship. We will explore the boundaries of collaboration between university and industry, but in a situation where there are both private returns and public returns. Only some actors will later translate and combine knowledge into innovations and value. Previous literature on knowledge-intensive innovative firms has shown that they, and their respective specialized knowledge, can be found not only in academic spin-offs and high-tech sectors, but also across manufacturing and creative industries, and in products as well as service sectors. Extensive literature on national, regional, sectoral and technological innovation systems have defined the actors. Rather than examining the actors per se, we take a different approach, shift the analysis from these firms per se, to the ecosystem and specifically to university-industry interactions. This paper explores how the conceptual model of an evolutionary governance regime at the interface of science and technology with knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship helps us understand the attributes of such an ecosystem. This model explicitly involves evolutionary processes for innovation and entrepreneurship, in that we focus upon 1) processes of variety and selection as well as 2) the particular characteristics of knowledge as well as organizational routines and capabilities 3) for developing, diffusing and using scientific and technological knowledge relevant for innovation.},

Our analysis identifies two phases: The first phase is creating the centre, through developing a formal organizational structure, which relies on pre-existing knowledge networks. The second phase is maintaining and dismantling the centre, which is constituted through micro-level activities. Difficulties arise with hybridizing the logics. We interpret that placing too much focus on ‘becoming an entrepreneurial university’ through a formal organizational structure can take too much time away from the on-going activities. The ‘commercial logic’ is interpreted differently by each industrial partner, which causes difficulties in deciding about research, due to the uncertain nature of science per se. We describe a new type of ‘societal engagement logic’, in this case related to sustainability.},

A firm employed {PhD} student is a person who is enrolled at the university as a {PhD} student while at the same time being employed at the firm. We extend an existing conceptual framework, which suggests that there are two pathways whereby collaborative research between university and industry may impact innovation outcomes within firms.

	isbn = {978-91-89301-99-3},
	abstract = {Knowledge-intensive innovative ecosystems should become the main focus of Swedish public policy. Policymakers can follow six design principles in order to create capabilities and innovation governance; these principles are specifically focused on creating, maintaining and diffusing knowledge- intensive innovative ecosystems across the economy and society. Note that in contrast to some existing viewpoints about public policy, this is not a story only about the centralized decisionmaker, academic entrepreneurship or high- tech industries. Nor it is a story about the deficiencies of the university and higher education sector. In contrast, this chapter argues that Swedish public policy needs new capabilities to promote fruitful linkages and interactions, which can be usefully thought of in terms of experimental policy. This is in line with this report, including recent research such as Lindholm-Dahlstrand et al, 2018). Moreover, these knowledge-intensive innovative ecosystems – hereafter {KI} ecosystems – can be found across the economy and society. Using public policy to stimulate them not only in such sectors as medicine and trans- portation, but also in new areas, such as sports, is needed to create competitiveness and growth. Developing more nuanced, receptive, and adaptive public policy for these purposes is needed, especially in a world that is being transformed by global trends, uncertainty about the future, and rapidly changing technology. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical perspective on knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms and ecosys- tems. Section 3 introduces the Swedish context, while Section 4 addresses the rhe- torical question of why we should care about innovation and entrepreneurship. This entreprenörskapsforum 61 kapitel 4 knowledge-intensive innovative ecosystems in sweden structure briefly outlines tempting but incorrect conclusions for policy, and indicates how this theoretical approach provides cognitive models for informed conclusions for public policy. Drawing directly from these informed conclusions, Section 5 proposes six design principles for stimulating knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial ecosystems through public policy.},

Since they often do so in collaboration with other organizations, this paper takes the next step by analyzing the influence of the number as well as the organization type of alliance partners on publication quality and impact. To make this argument, we analyze publications involving biotechnology or pharmaceutical firms and compare the results to publications that do not involve a firm. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset in pharmaceutical cancer research. The results indicate that firms need to carefully select their R\&D alliance partners, as shown in the literature. Our results indicate that increasing the number of partners may have diminishing returns. More surprisingly, firms should focus on establishing R\&D alliances with other firms to increase the probability of high-quality scientific publications. However, in terms of scientific impact, i.e., forward citations, firms do not benefit from having different types of alliance partners.},

Therefore, we place our version of the concept of ecosystem, in relation to the rapidly expanding literature on innovation ecosystems and entrepreneurial ecosystems more generally, which is being used in economic geography, strategy, and innovation studies more generally (Alvedalen \& Boschma 2017; Audretsch \& Belitski 2017; Adner, R. 2017; Jackson 2015; Spigel, B. 2017; Stam 2015).

Our case study focuses upon {KIE} entrepreneurship in horsetech, by examining the dynamics of a set of six {KIE} firms in horsetech in 1 European country (Sweden). This sport is the second largest in Sweden, with up to 30,00 people are employed, and 360 000 horses in a national population of 9 million. Within equestrian sports and horsetech more broadly, the case study focuses upon horsetech, with the companies analyzed Hoofstep, {RideQ}, Videquus, Equilab, Ridesum and Horsemeup. This represents the population of dedicated digital horse companies at the time of the study (Fall 2017-Spring 2018), based upon earlier empirical work on a broader range of topics (Berggren 2018; Hermansson 2018; Hermansson et al 2018). Our case study of {KIE} ventures in horsetech is based upon interviews with each founder, plus archival material, site visits, public records, and business data. Each of these {KIE} companies is primarily focused upon using software and {IT} to improve communication, training/competition, control and thereby improve safety, performance and equestrian well being. The companies are all early stage ventures, thereby with a focus upon processes from idea to project to company, with some indications of the possibilities of scale-up. The six companies are briefly presented historically, and then compared and contrasted in terms of: idea, knowledge required, what is innovation, sales/product/use and financing/revenues. In doing this analysis, the focus is upon the co-evolution between these {KIE} venture and the surrounding {KI} ecosystem. Our case study demonstrates how co-evolution plays out over time, and specifically in relation to the model proposed by Malerba and {McKelvey} (2018). Our focus is upon the co-evolution between knowledge and innovation, in ways which shape innovative opportunities. Specifically, we indicate how these {KIE} firms can use digital and new technologies, products, and services to push new consumption patterns, which in turn creates new market opportunities in the form of new goods and services. Therefore, tackling co-evolution of {KIE} entrepreneurship requires an understanding of what knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship mean, also in the context of sectors such as cultural and creative sectors as well as what is studied here, namely sports in traditional sectors.},

	abstract = {This study contributes to advance understanding on the micro-level foundations of the relationship between scientific research and innovation. We adopt a relational approach to scientific research networks through the analysis of the content of network ties, in contrast to more standard network approaches which are grounded on structural features of networks. We argue that the perceived legitimacy afforded through ties within research networks play a critical role in reconciling the conflicting logics of science and innovation. The proposed hypotheses are empirically tested in the context of the Spanish biomedical research system, drawing on a large scale survey of biomedical scientists. Our results indicate that scientists’ acquisition of legitimacy through their research network plays a critical role in the context of the translation from scientific research to technological achievements and innovations. These results confirm that the content of network ties provides a critical perspective into the analysis of network resource mobilization, well beyond the explanatory power of network properties based on structure and composition. Our findings also show that past scientific impact has a reinforcing effect on the relationship between legitimacy acquisition through network ties and innovation. On the contrary, we find that direct interaction with beneficiaries provides an alternative path to reconcile the conflicting logics of science and market, by compensating for the lack of acquired legitimacy from personal research networks.},

	title = {Sleeping beauties in nanotechnology},
	abstract = {In this paper we explore the patterns of patent citations in nanotechnology. We apply the concept of sleeping beauty in order to identify patents which have been “sleeping” for some time but made a great technological impact in terms of citations when they “woke up”. In order to do that we categorize the patents into three different groups: the sleepers, the beauties and, by combining these two, the sleeping beauties. We present statistics and econometric models which show their distribution in nanotechnology as well as an exploration of the factors affecting the probability of a patent to fall in each category. Nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field of particular interest and possible implications to the citations patterns and to the sleeping beauty phenomenon. We test two hypotheses in order to test which factors affect the probability of being a sleeping beauty. The first hypothesis is related to patent ownership and the second related to basic and applied nature of patents. Preliminary results show that sleeping beauties are particularly relevant to the nanotechnology field. It is also scattered within few specific {IPC} subclasses. When it comes to the factors of leading to a sleeping beauty patent the question remains a mystery since the models show a different pattern than the other two categories.},

	title = {Exploring Investigator Networks in Clinical Tripals},
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to explore the endogenous dynamics within a network of clinical trial investigators. Clinical trials provide an ideal context for our study since clinical trial investigators need to collaborate in the management of geographically dispersed clinical trials. Moreover, the interdependent nature of trial-related tasks requires bio-medical knowledge from different (sub-)disciplines (Hoekman et al., 2012; Malterud, 2001; Patel et al., 1999). Since most investigators are trained in one specific scientific discipline but lack knowledge in other disciplines ({FitzGerald}, 2005), cross-disciplinary collaboration with experienced investigators and professional networks provide opportunities to access the required skills and to transfer knowledge (O‘Connell and Roblin, 2006; Reagans and {McEvily}, 2003; Uzzi and Lancaster, 2003). In contrast to the large amount of anecdotal evidence within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry suggesting that clinical trial investigators can influence the success of clinical research (Huckman and Zinner, 2008), empirical evidence based on sophisticated analyses of investigators’ importance for clinical trials outcomes is quite scarce. This is surprising since the investigators are, as lead scientists of clinical trials, responsible and accountable for how the entire clinical study is conducted (Hoekman et al., 2012). Moreover, the increased access to diverse knowledge enables investigators to balance their knowledge between basic and clinical research which increases the likelihood of clinical trial success in individual as well as collaborative clinical research (Assmus and Haeussler, 2017).},
